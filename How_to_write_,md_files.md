# 📝 Markdown (.md) Basics

Markdown is a lightweight markup language used to format text. It’s used in README files, docs, blogs, and more. Below are the most common things you'll use.

## 🔤 Headings

Use `#` for headings (1 to 6 levels)

```md
# H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6
```

## 📄 Paragraphs & Line Breaks

Just leave a blank line between paragraphs.

Use `two spaces` at the end of a line to add a line break  
like this.

[Link Text](https://example.com)

If you want, I can also generate the folder structure for a basic `DevNotes` GitHub repo and even prep a `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, or anything else you want to roll with. Just say **"deploy it"** 🚀
