## Null pointers
**Null Pointers: A Quick Overview**

A **null pointer** is a special value that a pointer holds to indicate it is not pointing to any valid memory or object. It's like saying, "Hey, I donâ€™t know where to go yet!"

In programming, when you use a pointer to store the address of a variable, a **null pointer** tells the program, "There is no address stored here right now."

---

**FAQ: Null Pointers**

**1. What is a null pointer?**  
A **null pointer** is a pointer that does not point to any valid memory location or object. It's like saying "I don't point to anything yet!"

**2. Does a null pointer take up memory?**  
Yes, even though a null pointer doesnâ€™t point to anything useful, it still takes up memory because it is a variable. The memory required is the size needed to store the pointer itself (e.g., 4 or 8 bytes depending on the system).

**3. What happens if I try to use a null pointer?**  
Trying to access or use a null pointer (called **dereferencing**) can cause errors, like crashes or undefined behavior. The program gets confused because itâ€™s trying to use something that points to nothing.

**4. How do I avoid null pointer errors?**  
Always check if the pointer is `null` before you try to use it:

```cpp
if (pointer != NULL) {
    
}
